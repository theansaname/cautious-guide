Dev Notes:
* used https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app as my boiler plate
* wanted to keep the package.json minimal, so didn't add any extra packages
* wanted to do pagination, but its not a requirement
* wanted to check for limits on recentSearches, but its not a requirement
* could have made recentSearches a component, but didn't have time
* wanted to add a gif page
* wanted to layout the gifs on their preview sizes and have it "fit" together
* wanted to add snazzier "button" look to the recent search terms
* wanted to add unit tests for the App functions, but didn't have time to resolve dependancies with enzyme
